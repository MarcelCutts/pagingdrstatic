# TypeScript



- ### ✅ Exceptional tooling
- ### ✅ Great library definitions
- ### ✅ Largest community


- ### 🚨 Verbose
- ### 🚨 Not type sound
- ### 🚨 Too permissive
- ### 🚨 Lock in

export default Horizontal

# Flow

- ### ✅ Rad type inference
- ### ✅ Type soundness
- ### ✅ Ejection guaranteed


- ### 🚨 Embarrassing tooling
- ### 🚨 Smaller community
- ### 🚨 Higher chance of frustration

---
export default Horizontal

# Reason

- ### ✅ Type inference like _woah_
- ### ✅ Performanance is amazing
- ### ✅ Complete package


- ### 🚨 Still very new
- ### 🚨 You _will_ write bindings
- ### 🚨 Ejection story is "OK"
