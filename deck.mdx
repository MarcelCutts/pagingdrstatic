# Static Types!

# Static types offer a lot

# Types PROMISE

- ### + Confidence in code
- ### + Faster refactoring
- ### + No runtime erors


- ### + Fewer test cases
- ### + Improved reability
- ### + Tooling support
---
export default Horizontal

# Types have a COST

- ### - Writing type definitons
- ### - Maintaining type   definitons
- ### - Managing third party definitions 
- ### ️ - Editor tooling


- ### - Defensive coding
- ### - Build process changes
- ### - Opportunity cost
- ### - Long term risk
- ### - People

# Risk
## Can you get out?

## People are always tricky

## Treat types like a 
# SURGEON

## Focus on how static types can

## and while minimising harm

# The PROCESS

- ## Can static types help?
- ## Which tool fits best?
- ## Can we minimise costs?
---
export default Invert

# Where can static types help?
---
# Don't guess!
# Be _DATA DRIVEN_
---
# Avoid _low hanging fruit_
## (And personal vendettas...) 
---
# How to be data driven
- ### Have centralised logging
- ### Keep an eye on metrics
- ### Do root cause analysis on bugs
- ### Find patterns

# What are our tools?

export default Horizontal

# TypeScript

# Flow

# Reason
---
export default Horizontal

# TypeScript


- ### + Exceptional tooling
- ### + Great library definitions
- ### + Largest community


- ### - Verbose
- ### - Not type sound
- ### - Too permissive
- ### - Lock in

---
export default Horizontal

# Flow

- ### + Rad type inference
- ### + Type soundness
- ### + Ejection guaranteed


- ### - Embarrassing tooling
- ### - Smaller community
- ### - Higher chance of frustration

---
export default Horizontal

# Reason

- ### + Type inference like _woah_
- ### + Performanance is amazing
- ### + Complete package


- ### - Still very new
- ### - You _will_ write bindings
- ### - Ejection story is "OK"

- ### Don't be too clever
- ### Automate, if you can

# Hunting for types!

1. ### You could guess and refine
1. ### Documentation? Alright...
1. ### GraphQL schema? Bingo!
---
# Let's add those types!

export default SplitThird

# The PROCESS

- ## Can static types help?
- ## Which tool fits best?
- ## Can we minimise costs?

# Costs still high

- ### Will the API change?
- ### Who's going maintain it?
- ### Syntax updates?
---
# Can we do better?
## What about GraphQL types?

## "Doctor doctor! Your corporate purchasing app is unreliable!"

# UNACCEPTABLE
```notes
The backbone of every shadowy organisation is its purchasing and expensing process, just ask GRU
```
---
# Symptoms

- ### Can't add items to wishlist reliably
- ### Bypass codes aren't working
- ### Crashes when ArchMinion uses it

---
export default Horizontal 

# Asgard purchasing


- ### There is a SHOPPING LIST and a WISH LIST
- ### Doctors can add anything to the SHOPPING LIST
- ### ~~Minions~~ staff can add anything to the WISH LIST


- ### Up to three things can be on the WISH LIST
- ### A allows stadd any additon to WISH LIST 
- ### If item is "cake", it gets added without checks
---
# Types don't just catch mistakes
# Good types can _offer clarity_
---
export default Horizontal

# Outcome


- ## + Greater certainty
- ## + Business logic clarity
- ## + Room for growth


- ## - Contexting switching
- ## - Additional technology
- ## - Type parity maintenance
